# Siren, A Railway E-Ticket System
This project, Siren, is a comprehensive Railway E-Ticket System developed using PostgreSQL, React, and Node.js. The system is designed to handle various functionalities of a railway ticket booking platform, including user registration, ticket booking, payment integration, and ticket management.

## Features
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
* Ticket Booking: Allows users to search for trains, select routes, and book tickets.
* Payment System Integration: Seamlessly integrates payment methods for ticket purchase.
* Admin Panel: Enables admins to manage train schedules, bookings, and users.
* CSV Data Imports: Utilizes pre-generated CSV files for easy population of the database with real-world data.

## Data
The project comes with Excel and CSV files containing sample data which can be used to populate the system's database. There are also Python scripts that extract values from these files and generate the corresponding CSV files required for importing data into PostgreSQL.

Included:
* Excel files containing initial train schedules, booking data, and user details.
* Python code that processes Excel files and outputs structured CSV files.
* Dummy CSV files to demonstrate how the data is structured in the database.

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node.js
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Python: For data extraction and CSV generation
